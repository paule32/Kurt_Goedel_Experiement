# Kurt_Goedel_Experiment
This is just a fun Project that is faced from the "Kurt Goedel" Therom of incomplete sentences. Produced with SBCL - a Common Lisp implementation. Free for non-profit usage.
I work on a German Lexicon (Duden) Database, that I use for the Words, that builds the Sentences.
The Senetences would be verifery with the Idea from "Kurt Goedel's" Therom - where he was used Prime Numbers for a rich amount of Formulas.
In my Project, the Forumulas are Words, and Sentences.
Feel free to drop a Message with future Ideas or improvements.
